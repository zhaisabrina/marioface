An application that uses FaceOSC and your facial movements to control your keyboard.

Currently available options:

To use this application, make sure you follow these steps:
1. Download FaceOSC on Mac's page. You need both this application and FaceOSC running to be able to use it.
2. Go into your computer settings and allow this application to make changes in your computer. Th
3. Make sure you're clicked into the application you want to use it on. 

This application was created on Processing. I have also uploaded the source code under src if you want to see any behind the scenes action! :) 

I used an online emulator and a Mac OS to test this application! That being said, this application is very much in the beta stage of its completion. For process, feel free to check out my progress updates my class website.

If you run into any issues using this application, feel free to contact me @ szhai@andrew.cmu.edu
